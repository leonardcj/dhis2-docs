        The difference between the two is that, here notes are attached not to events but to
        enrollments. This helps to record some notes based on enrollment - for example why is an
        enrollment terminated or what is the overall observation of the TEI throughout the
        enrollment. In addition, if the tracked entity has registered a phone number, messaging will
        be available here. With messaging, you can send SMS to the phone number registered.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch26s08.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch26.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch26s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">26.8.&nbsp;Enter
